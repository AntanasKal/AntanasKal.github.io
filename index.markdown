I am Antanas Kalkauskas. I am a PhD student at Nanyang Technological University Singapore. I am supervised by [Dr Conrad Watt](https://conrad-watt.github.io/).My research interests are formal verification, mechanisation of programming language semantics, and WebAssembly language.

Prior to starting my PhD I worked at [Sensmetry](https://sensmetry.com/) back home in Lithuania. Prior to that I studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
